Today, I released version 0.6.0 of CDPlayer.app. It's been a quite long time since the last release, but now it is here. It's main new features are:

<ul>
<li>Moved from libaudiocd to libcdio and friends.</li>
<li>Use Cynthiune's output backends for audio output.</li>
<li>Removed the preference pane for AudioCD.bundle as it no longer has any preferences.</li>
<li>Added an output volume control</li>
<li>Applied a couple of patches provided by Sebastion Reitenbach to make CDPlayer compile and run on OpenBSD.</li>
</ul>

You my download the soure code for CDPlayer from my [github repository](https://github.com/schik/cdplayer/releases/tag/v0.6.0).
