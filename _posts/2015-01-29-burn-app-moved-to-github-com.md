Today, Burn.app was moved from SF.net to github.com. The main reason is that
all my other projects as well as my web site are hosted here. Moreover, I
think that github's structure of user/projects suits me better than the
project centric approach of SF.net.
If you want to have the latest version of Burn.app you have to come here in
the future. Not that much development is going on recently ;-)
