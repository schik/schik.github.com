Today, I released version 0.6.0 of Burn.app. Burn is a program to burn CDs. It provides a graphical frontend for cdrtools (or related projects, e.g. cdrkit, cdrskin) and cdrdao. Some of the recent changes are:

<ul>
<li>The project window now uses a configurable toolbar.</li>
<li>Files can now be added using the NSOpenPanel. This is handy if you don't use GWorkspace for D'n'D.</li>
<li>The parameters dialog is opened always before burning as this is safer. The old parameters may not match your current compilation which could be fatal.</li>
<li>The inspectors have undergone a major overhaul.</li>
<li>The main application and the bundles now use reasonable defaults.</li>
<li>The hardware detection is now more robust and reliable.</li>
<li>New icons.</li>
<li>Many more. See the project page for details.</li>
</ul>

You my download the soure code for Burn from my [github repository](https://github.com/schik/burn/releases/tag/burn_v0.6.0).

The whole Burn repository is located [here](https://github.com/schik/burn).
